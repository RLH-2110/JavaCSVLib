# JavaCSVLib
This is an abandoned Java project, I worked at it during my downtime while I had to program in Java. I do not wish to download the tools that I had used before to help create this, nor do I want to program much in Java.

This program was supposed to turn any arbitrary Object and save it to a CSV file by recursively going through the class attributes and the super class's attributes until it only has primitive types.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project was archived to github in the middle of a bugfix, the main branch does not contain any code, the broken code is on another branch.
